## 00 Poems about the bridge
Bridges not only exist in real life to help people gather and communicate, it also constitutes a fascinating poetic world.

A little reverie, "As you are enjoying the scenery on a bridge, Upstairs on a tower people are watching you."Poems from Bian Zhilin(卞之琳)'s "Part of Article"(《断章》), Translated from William Wang(宛城卧龙).

A kind of sadness, "Over old trees wreathed with rotten vines fly evening crows; Under a small bridge near a cottage a stream flows" The poem comes from Ma Zhiyuan(马致远)'s "Sunny Sand · Autumn Thoughts"(《天净沙·秋思》) in Yuan Dynasty.

Also a trace of love, "Their tender love flows like a stream; Their happy date seems but a dream. How can they bear a separate homeward way?" The poem comes from Qin Guan(秦观)'s "Immortals at the Magpie Bridge · Slim Cloud Makes a Clever"(《鹊桥仙·纤云弄巧》)in Song Dynasty.

Let us explore the ultimate beauty of the ancient bridge.

 ## 01 Origin of Ancient Bridge
 The essence of the bridge is to connect. As an "airway" to communicate between the two sides, it is its mission.

The bridge presents ever-changing appearances in different natural environments.

### Zip-line bridge
There are deep valleys in southwest China, and the ropes and iron cables connecting the two sides of the river are the best choice for crossing the river.

The single zipline on the Nujiang River is located near Liuku Village(六库村), Lushui County(泸水县), Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan. Photographer Rui Jing(芮京)▼

### Pontoon bridge
People try to connect the boats to each other where the current is slightly slower, and the floating bridge is used as a floating bridge between the two banks.

Guangji Bridge(广济桥) in Chaozhou, Guangdong, was built in the Southern Song Dynasty in 1171 AD. It was originally a pontoon bridge. Now it integrates a girder bridge and a pontoon bridge. The pontoon bridge can be opened for the passage of large ships. The picture below shows the splicing site of the pontoon bridge. Photographer Lin Yuxian(林宇先)▼

In an era without steel and concrete, pontoon bridges can overcome difficulties in the face of super-large rivers such as the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, and the moat can become a thoroughfare.

### Beam bridge
More bridges use beams as the main load-bearing structure. Some single-wood bridges, some erect stones for crossing.

### Stone pier wooden bridge
The ancients used more durable stone instead of wood to make bridge piers, which are stone piers and wooden beam bridges.

The ship-shaped piers weaken the impact of the current with their sharp facing surface, making the piers more stable.
