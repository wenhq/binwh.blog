## Reasons for Use

Windows Remote Desktop allows users to access and control another Windows computer from a remote location. However, the Home editions of Windows 10 and Windows 11 do not support remote desktop functionality by default and have a single login limitation, meaning that when one user logs in, other users cannot continue to use the system. 

RDPWrap is an enhancement tool that addresses these issues, allowing multiple users to log in remotely to the same Windows computer simultaneously.

## Steps for Operation

### Download and Installation

- Download RDP Wrapper Library v1.6.2 from  [https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/releases](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/releases).
- Extract the files to any folder.
- Run `install.bat` as an administrator to install.
- After installation, `rdpwrap.dll` and `rdpwrap.ini` files will be generated in `C:\Program Files\RDP Wrapper`.

### Configuration and Verification

- Run `RDPConf.exe` for configuration; under normal circumstances, the Listener state should display as "fully supported."
- Use `RDPCheck.exe` for testing; if successful, the remote desktop login interface will be displayed.

## Common Issues and Solutions

The main issue is **Listener State shows not Listening or not supported**.

Solution:

- Check if the `rdpwrap.ini` file contains configuration information that matches your system version. If not, you need to find a matching configuration file from GitHub issues or provided resources and replace it.
- After updating `rdpwrap.ini`, you need to restart the `termservice` service or reboot your computer for the changes to take effect. Use the following commands:`net stop termservice net start termservice`
- If you encounter permission issues, run the above commands using PowerShell with administrator privileges.
